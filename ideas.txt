random tree chopping
shadows under the ocean
spooky sounds (chopping sounds, walking sounds, maybe running?, mining sounds, whispers, etc)
no music/better music blending for scary occurences
fake stat changes (health, hunger, wetness)
throw in some cool shaders maybe idk
maybe some spooky creatures in the distance
ocean bird getting swallowed by the ocean

completely overhaul the insanity vfx
- no desaturation (or at least heavily lowered)
- no swirling screen edges
- play around with sharpness and maybe some shaders
